                        Marianas Press, or MP, was established in November 2024, born out of the dream of its
                        founder,
                        Thomas Manglo√±a II, to form a truly independent multimedia news outlet in his home islands.
                        MP aims
                        to deliver timely digital news about the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
                        (CNMI), the
                        Pacific, and beyond.

                        MP strives to inform the public with deeply reported multimedia content focused on the
                        issues that
                        matter. In a world of fake news, misinformation, and disinformation, MP hopes to quiet the
                        noise
                        surrounding current events to deliver the truth and hold those in power accountable.

                        Local news matters and MP hopes to help every voice find its story.

                        is to
                        provide useful multimedia news reports for the community. We aim to build a stronger sense
                        of
                        community by reaching diverse audiences and provide in-depth and original multimedia
                        reporting for
                        underrepresented communities and issues. By approaching stories holistically, we work
                        towards
                        pushing the boundaries of traditional media. </p>

                    <p class="font-light text-gray-500 sm:text-xl dark:text-gray-400">Marianas Press values its
                        independence
                        and is committed to transparency, accountability, and integrity. Transparency allows the
                        community
                        to witness firsthand how its government and institutions make decisions that impact their
                        daily
                        lives. Accountability ensures that when there is wrongdoing, it is brought to light and
                        corrected.
                        Integrity is the foundation of our reporting in pursuit of the truth. A robust and
                        independent press
                        is critical to a thriving democracy.</p>
